# Serverless GraphQL API

![](../../images/chapter_headers/serverless-graphql.svg)

Say you're building an app. It needs data from a server. What do you do?

You make a `fetch()` request.

```javascript
fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

And you get eeeevery piece of info about Luke Skywalker.

```json
{
  "name": "Luke Skywalker",
  "height": "172",
  "mass": "77",
  "hair_color": "blond",
  "skin_color": "fair",
  "eye_color": "blue",
  "birth_year": "19BBY",
  "gender": "male",
  "homeworld": "https://swapi.dev/api/planets/1/",
  "films": [
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/2/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/6/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/3/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/1/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/7/"
  ],
  "species": ["https://swapi.dev/api/species/1/"],
  "vehicles": [
    "https://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/14/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/30/"
  ],
  "starships": [
    "https://swapi.dev/api/starships/12/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/starships/22/"
  ],
  "created": "2014-12-09T13:50:51.644000Z",
  "edited": "2014-12-20T21:17:56.891000Z",
  "url": "https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/"
}
```

Frustrating ... all you wanted was his name and hair color. Why's the API sending you all this crap? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And what's this about Luke's species being `1`? What the heck is `1`?

You make another fetch request.

```javascript
fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/species/1/")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

You get data about humans. Great.

```json
{
  "name": "Human",
  "classification": "mammal",
  "designation": "sentient",
  "average_height": "180",
  "skin_colors": "caucasian, black, asian, hispanic",
  "hair_colors": "blonde, brown, black, red",
  "eye_colors": "brown, blue, green, hazel, grey, amber",
  "average_lifespan": "120",
  "homeworld": "https://swapi.dev/api/planets/9/",
  "language": "Galactic Basic",
  "people": [
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/4/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/5/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/6/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/7/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/9/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/10/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/11/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/12/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/14/",

    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/25/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/26/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/28/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/29/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/32/",

    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/51/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/60/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/61/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/62/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/66/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/67/",

    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/81/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/84/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/85/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/86/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/35/"
  ],
  "films": [
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/2/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/7/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/5/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/4/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/6/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/3/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/1/"
  ],
  "created": "2014-12-10T13:52:11.567000Z",
  "edited": "2015-04-17T06:59:55.850671Z",
  "url": "https://swapi.dev/api/species/1/"
}
```

That's a lot of JSON to get the word `"Human"` out of the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) ...

![](giphy:eyeroll)

What about Luke's starships? There's 2 and that means 2 more API requests ...

```javascript
fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/starships/12/")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then(console.log)

fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/starships/22/")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

Wanna know how much JSON that dumps? Try a guess. üôÑ

You made **4 API requests** and transferred a bunch of data to find out that Luke Skywalker is human, has blond hair, and flies an X-Wing and an Imperial Shuttle.

And guess what, you didn't cache anything. How often do you think this data changes? Once a year? Twice?

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## GraphQL to the rescue

Here's what the same process looks like with GraphQL.

```graphql
query luke {
  // id found through allPeople query
  person(id: "cGVvcGxlOjE=") {
    name
    hairColor
    species {
      name
    }
    starshipConnection {
      starships {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And the API returns what you wanted with 1 request.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "person": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "hairColor": "blond",
      "species": null,
      "starshipConnection": {
        "starships": [
          {
            "name": "X-wing"
          },
          {
            "name": "Imperial shuttle"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

An API mechanism that gives you flexibility on the frontend, slashes API requests, _and doesn't transfer data you don't need?_

üò≤

Write a query, say what you want, send to an endpoint, GraphQL figures out the rest. Want different params? Just say so. Want multiple models? Got it. Wanna go deep? You can.

Without changes on the server. Within reason.

GraphQL client libraries can add caching to avoid duplicate requests. And because queries are structured, clients can merge queries into 1 API call.

I fell in love the moment it clicked.

You can [try it on graphql.org's public playground](http://graphql.org/swapi-graphql)

## What _is_ GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL) is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.

Touted as a replacement for REST, GraphQL is actually a different approach to APIs. Better for common use-cases and with its own drawbacks.

Don't let the propaganda fool you üëâ you can and *should* use both REST *and* GraphQL. Depends on what you're doing.

GraphQL's benefit is its declarative nature.

On the client, you describe the shape of what you want and GraphQL figures it out. On the server, you write resolver functions for sub-queries and GraphQL combines them into the full result.

REST queries can be declarative on the client, while GraphQL is declarative on both ends. For reads _and_ writes.

### GraphQL queries

GraphQL queries fetch data. Following this pattern:

```graphql
query {
  what_you_want {
    its_property
  }
}
```

You nest fields ‚Äì¬†representing your models ‚Äì and properties into queries to describe what you're looking for. You can go as deep as you want.

Write fields side-by-side to execute multiple queries with a single API request.

```graphql
query {
  what_you_want {
    its_property
  }
  other_thing_you_want {
    its_property {
      property_of_property
    }
  }
}
```

This is where the power and flexibility come from.

Variables let you create dynamic queries and build complex filters to limit the scope of your result.

```graphql
query queryName($filterProp: "value") {
	field(filterProp: $filterProp) {
		property1
		property3
	}
}
```

`$filterProp` defines a new variable that the `field()` lookup uses to filter results for those matching `"value"`.

GraphQL comes with basic equality filters built-in and you're encouraged to add more in your resolvers. Typical projects choose to support sorting, greater-than, not-equals, etc.

### GraphQL mutations

GraphQL mutations write data. Following this pattern:

```graphql
mutation {
  what_youre_updating(argument: "value", argument2: "value 2") {
    prop_you_want_back
  }
}
```

Like a query with arguments, you specify what you're updating and pass your values. What's available depends on how mutation resolvers are implemented on the server.

The mutation body specifies what you'd like returned. Same as a query.

Like queries, you can put mutations side-by-side and use variables.

```
mutation mutationName($argument: "value") {
	what_youre_updating(argument: $argument) {
		prop_you_want_back
	}

	other_field(argument: $argument) {
		return_prop
	}
}
```

## GraphQL vs. REST, which to use and when

The GraphQL vs. REST debate is a false dichotomy.

People like to say GraphQL is _replacing_ REST and that's not the case. GraphQL is _augmenting_ REST.

Will GraphQL become the default API layer? It might.

Should you rip out your REST API and rewrite for GraphQL? Please don't.

GraphQL doesn't care where data comes from. Relational database, NoSQL database, files, a REST API, another GraphQL API ... All you need is a function that reads data in response to a query.

You can [start using GraphQL without changing your existing server](https://swizec.com/blog/how-you-can-start-using-graphql-today-without-changing-the-backend/) with a GraphQL middle layer. Create a GraphQL server on top of your REST API.

![](giphy:wow)

### How do you choose between REST and GraphQL?

When building a typical CRUD ‚Äì¬†Create, Read, Update, Delete ‚Äì API, I like to ask 6 questions:

1. Is this a new project? _Default to GraphQL_
2. Do I know in advance what clients are going to need? _REST is great_
3. Am I fetching small subsets of large data? _GraphQL_
4. Am I generating new values for each request? _REST_
5. Updating a few properties on an object? _GraphQL_
6. Submitting large payloads to be saved? _REST_

Use upserts to deal with Create and Update. Avoid deletes.

### Should you expose your entire data model verbatim?

No.

Exposing your full data model¬†is a common mistake in API design. 

Define a clean API using [domain driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design). How your backend stores data for max performance and good database design differs from how clients think about that data.

An "access to everything" API style is hard to use, leads to security issues, is difficult to maintain, and tightly couples servers and clients. You'll have to update both server and client for any DB change. 

Then there's the question of derived and computed properties with complex business logic. You don't want to re-implement those on the client using raw data from your database.

## How to create a serverless GraphQL server

![Example create mutation from server below](../../images/graphql-playground.png)

There's many ways to build a GraphQL server, the nicest I've found is with [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)'s [apollo-server-lambda](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-lambda) package.

You follow a 4 step process:

1. Add lambda to your `serverless.yml` file
2. Initialize the Apollo server
3. Specify your schema
4. Add resolvers

We created a [small REST API](https://serverlesshandbook.dev/serverless-rest-api#build-a-simple-rest) in the previous chapter, let's recreate it with GraphQL. [Full code on GitHub](https://github.com/Swizec/serverlesshandbook.dev/tree/master/examples/serverless-graphql-example)

Apollo creates a GraphQL playground for us. You can try my implementation here:

<iframe
  src="https://yrqqg5l31m.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/graphql"
  style={{ width: "120%", border: 0, height: "600px" }}
></iframe>

Change the URL inside the playground to: `https://yrqqg5l31m.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/graphql`. Apollo drops the `/dev/` part.

### serverless.yml

We define a new function in the `functions:` section.

```yaml
# serverless.yml

functions:
  graphql:
    handler: dist/graphql.handler
    events:
      - http:
          path: graphql
          method: GET
          cors: true
      - http:
          path: graphql
          method: POST
          cors: true
```

The convention is to use the `/graphql` endpoint for everything. 

Make sure to define both `GET` and `POST` endpoints. `GET` serves the Apollo playground, `POST` handles the queries and mutations.

### initialize Apollo server

Every Apollo server needs a schema, a resolvers object, and the initialized server. Like this:

```typescript
// src/graphql.ts

import { ApolloServer, gql } from "apollo-server-lambda"

// this is where we define the shape of our API
const schema = gql``

// this is where the shape maps to functions
const resolvers = {
  Query: {},
  Mutation: {},
}

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs: schema, resolvers })

export const handler = server.createHandler({
  cors: {
    origin: "*", // for security in production, lock this to your real URLs
    credentials: true,
  },
})
```

This server won't run because the `schema` and `resolvers` don't match. Resolvers have fields that the schema does not.

We'll add type definitions to the schema and a resolver for each `Query` and `Mutation`.

### specify your schema

Your schema defines the shape of your API. Every type of object your server returns and every query and mutation definition.

You get a type-safe API because GraphQL ensures objects follow this schema. Both when coming into the API and when flying out.

To mimic our [CRUD API from before](https://serverlesshandbook.dev/serverless-rest-api#build-a-simple-rest), we use a schema like this:

```typescript
// src/graphql.ts

const schema = gql`
  type Item {
    id: String
    name: String
    body: String
    createdAt: String
    updatedAt: String
  }

  type Query {
    item(id: String!): Item
  }

  type Mutation {
    updateItem(id: String, name: String, body: String): Item
    deleteItem(id: String!): Item
  }
`
```

With REST, users could store and retrieve arbitrary JSON blobs. GraphQL doesn't support that. Instead, we define an `Item` type with an arbitrary `body` string.

You can use that to store serialized JSON objects.

Each item will have an `id`, a `name`, and a few timestamps managed by the server. Those help with debugging.

Our `item()` query lets you retrieve items and requires an `id` to work. That's the exclamation point after `String`.

Then we have a mutation for upserting items and a mutation for deleting.

### create your resolvers

We have 1 query and 2 mutations. That means we'll need 3 resolver functions.

We can copy these from the [REST implementation](https://serverlesshandbook.dev/serverless-rest-api#build-a-simple-rest) and change how we get arguments.

I like to put queries in a `src/queries.ts` file and mutations in a `src/mutations.ts`. You can organize this by model as your implementation grows.

#### item()

The `item()` query is a basic fetch and looks like this:

```typescript
// src/queries.ts

import * as db from "simple-dynamodb"

function remapProps(item: any) {
  return {
    ...item,
    id: item.itemId,
    name: item.itemName,
  }
}

// fetch using item(id: String)
export const item = async (_: any, args: { id: string }) => {
  const item = await db.getItem({
    TableName: process.env.ITEM_TABLE!,
    Key: {
      itemId: args.id,
    },
  })

  return remapProps(item.Item)
}
```

We can ignore Apollo's first resolver argument. The second argument is where query and mutation values come in.

Since `id` is a required param, you don't have to check for nulls. GraphQL handles that before calling your resolver.

You can call `getItem` on DynamoDB, or run a SQL query for a relational database, and return the result. GraphQL handles the rest.

**One niggle to note üëâ** DynamoDB considers `name` and `id` reserved attributes. We remap them to `itemName` and `itemId` when saving and have to map them back when reading.

This is what I meant by _"You don't want to expose raw database details to your API"_ :)

#### updateItem()

The `updateItem()` mutation is our upsert.

It creates a new item when you don't send an `id` and updates the existing item when you do. If no item is found, the mutation throws an error.

And it handles `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps.

```
// src/mutations.ts

type ItemArgs = {
  id: string
  name: string
  body: string
}

// upsert an item
// item(name, ...) or item(id, name, ...)
export const updateItem = async (_: any, args: ItemArgs) => {
  let itemId = args.id ? args.id : uuidv4()

  let createdAt = new Date().toISOString()

  // find item if exists
  if (args.id) {
    const find = await db.getItem({
      TableName: process.env.ITEM_TABLE!,
      Key: { itemId },
    })

    if (find.Item) {
      // save createdAt so we don't overwrite on update
      createdAt = find.Item.createdAt
    } else {
      throw "Item not found"
    }
  }

  const updateValues = {
    itemName: args.name,
    body: args.body,
  }

  const item = await db.updateItem({
    TableName: process.env.ITEM_TABLE!,
    Key: { itemId },
    UpdateExpression: `SET ${db.buildExpression(
      updateValues
    )}, createdAt = :createdAt, updatedAt = :updatedAt`,
    ExpressionAttributeValues: {
      ...db.buildAttributes(updateValues),
      ":createdAt": createdAt,
      ":updatedAt": new Date().toISOString(),
    },
    ReturnValues: "ALL_NEW",
  })

  return remapProps(item.Attributes)
}
```

We take the id from arguments or create a new one with `uuidv4()`.

Then we try to find the item. 

If found, we change `createdAt` to the existing value. Otherwise we throw an error. That helps you avoid creating new items by accident because DynamoDB always upserts.

We define the `updateValues` and build a DynamoDB UPDATE query. This can look gnarly no matter what DB you use.

In the end, we return the object our database returned and let GraphQL handle the rest.

#### deleteItem()

The `deleteItem()` mutation is simple. GraphQL and the database do the work for us.

```typescript
// src/mutations.ts

export const deleteItem = async (_: any, args: { id: string }) => {
  // DynamoDB handles deleting already deleted objects, no error :)
  const item = await db.deleteItem({
    TableName: process.env.ITEM_TABLE!,
    Key: {
      itemId: args.id,
    },
    ReturnValues: "ALL_OLD",
  })

  return remapProps(item.Attributes)
}
```

We take the `id` from mutation arguments, ask our database to delete the row, and return the old attributes.

### add resolvers to the GraphQL server

We built the resolvers, now we add them to `graphql.ts`:

```typescript
// src/graphql.ts

import { item } from "./queries"
import { updateItem, deleteItem } from "./mutations"

// ...

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    item,
  },
  Mutation: {
    updateItem,
    deleteItem,
  },
}
```

This tells Apollo how to map queries and mutations to resolvers. We can use generic names because this is a small project.

You'll want to namespace in bigger apps.

### Try it out

Run `yarn deploy` and you get a GraphQL server. There's even an Apollo playground that helps you test.

<iframe
  src="https://yrqqg5l31m.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/graphql"
  style={{ width: "120%", border: 0, height: "600px" }}
></iframe>

Make sure you change the URL inside the playground to: `https://yrqqg5l31m.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/graphql`. Apollo drops the `/dev/` part.

## GraphQL no-code services

Wiring up GraphQL can get tedious with lots of repetitive code.

Various no-code and low-code solutions exist that do the work for you. Look at your database and magic a GraphQL server into existence.

They tend to exhibit the *expose entire DB as API* problem. But they can be a good starting point.

Next chapter we look at building lambda pipelines for distributed data processing.
